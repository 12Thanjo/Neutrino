# Neutrino
A programming language that compiles to NodeJS and was designed to make programming easier (at least for me).
`test.nt`  in the test folder has a usage example of every feature of Neutrino (it is the file I use to make sure everything is working).


### Usage
The `bin` folder contains the .bat files to run the Neutrino compile. `neutrino.bat` and `nt.bat` are the same, and `tau.bat` is for plugins. 

```batch
$ ./bin/neutrino.bat compile file_to_compile.nt
```

You can run `$./bin/neutrino.bat help` to see all of the functionality.
